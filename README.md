# What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is all about predicting a continuous value (like salary, price, temperature) based on another variable (like years of experience, number of products sold, etc.).

Let's say, We’re trying to predict someone's salary based on their years of experience. As experience increases, you generally expect the salary to increase too. What linear regression does is find the best line that fits this trend.

# The line is represented by this simple equation:
 => y = mx + b
Salary = m * Years of Experience + b    

Here:
m is the slope of the line (it tells you how much salary increases with each additional year of experience).
b is the y-intercept (the starting point, or the salary when there's no experience).

# What is the Process:

Training the model: The algorithm looks at all your data and tries to draw the straightest line possible that fits the pattern between experience and salary. It does this by adjusting the m (slope) and b (intercept) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual salaries.

Making predictions: Once the model has learned the best line, it can predict salaries for new people based on their years of experience. For example, if you tell it someone has 5 years of experience, it will give you the predicted salary.

Linear regression is great when there's a straight-line relationship between variables. It helps you make predictions, and because it’s simple, it’s often used as a starting point for many problems.
